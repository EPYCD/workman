the merged tasks whose commits you are behind on, the colliding paths with
their severity, and the exact commands, in your own worktree.

Severity is what makes this worth reading. OWNED means the integration branch
moved inside a file you claimed to edit, so a textual conflict is certain, not
likely. AFFECTED means it moved in something you declared you read but do not
edit: no conflict, but your assumptions and your gates are stale. Anything
outside your scope is counted and not listed, because forty commits behind in
files you never touch is noise.

It changes nothing. It does not fetch, it does not rebase, and it does not
touch the working tree — an agent's worktree is frequently dirty mid-edit, and
a half-finished rebase in one is materially worse than a stale branch. Run the
commands yourself when the tree is clean.

The lag it reads is computed by Marshal on its poll, so a branch you pushed
seconds ago may not be reflected yet.`,
