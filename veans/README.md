# veans

A beans-shaped CLI for Vikunja. Drop it into a repo, run `veans init`, paste a
hook snippet into your coding agent's settings, and the agent immediately
knows to track its work in Vikunja instead of in `TodoWrite` or `.beans/`.

veans is a thin Go binary that wraps Vikunja's REST API with an opinionated
agent-friendly surface and emits a system prompt teaching agents the workflow
(claim → work → in-review → human closes). The agent prompt is re-emitted on
every `SessionStart` and `PreCompact`, so context never goes stale.

## Quick start

Install `veans` and `marshal`. The repository is private, so the installers
need a GitHub token with `Contents: read` — or an authenticated `gh`.

```sh
# Linux and macOS (native builds for amd64 and arm64)
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPYCD/veans/main/install.sh)"
```

```powershell
# Windows (native; no WSL required)
$env:GH_TOKEN = "ghp_xxx"; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPYCD/veans/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then, from inside the repository you want coordinated:

```sh
veans onboard --server https://vikunja.example.com
```

One command and one login. It creates the project (or reuses one), the five
canonical buckets, the agent bot and the two service bots, shares the project
with each, mints their tokens, sets the receipt bot and claim bucket,
registers the webhook, and writes `.veans.yml`, `.marshal.yml`,
`.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, the four board workflows and the
composite action they call. Nothing is overwritten without `--force`, so it
is safe to re-run on a half-configured repository.

Print the CI token it reports as the repository secret `WORKMAN_TOKEN`; the
gates cannot close a task without it.

<summary>Doing it step by step instead</summary>

```sh
veans init --server https://vikunja.example.com   # board, bot, .veans.yml
marshal init                                      # .marshal.yml
marshal setup --token <admin token>               # service bots, webhook
```

`veans init` also offers to write the agent hooks itself. If you would rather
paste them, Claude Code takes `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "veans prime" }] }],
    "PreCompact":   [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "veans prime" }] }]
  }
}
```

and OpenCode takes `.opencode/plugin/veans-prime.ts`:

```ts
export const VeansPrime = {
  event: ["session.start", "compact.before"],
  handler: async ({ exec }) => exec("veans prime"),
}
```

</details>

`veans prime` exits silently with status 0 when no `.veans.yml` is reachable
upward from cwd, so the hook is safe to install in a global `~/.claude/`
without breaking sessions in unrelated repos.

## What `veans init` does

1. Authenticates as you. Default is OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE
   against Vikunja's built-in authorization server (Vikunja 2.3+ — no
   client registration needed). veans prints an authorize URL; you open
   it in your browser, sign in, and paste the resulting
   `vikunja-veans-cli://callback?code=...` URL back into the CLI. The
   browser will fail to open the custom scheme — that's expected; the
   address bar still has what we need.

   Alternative auth modes:
   - `--token <jwt-or-personal-api-token>` — paste-in, useful for SSO/OIDC
   - `--use-password` — fall back to `POST /login` (local accounts only)
   - `--username` + `--password` (non-interactive; implies `--use-password`)
2. Asks you to pick a project and a Kanban view.
3. Bootstraps the canonical buckets if missing: `Todo`, `In Progress`,
   `In Review`, `Done`, `Scrapped`.
4. Creates a `bot-<repo-name>` user (Vikunja bot user — no password, no
   email, can't log in interactively).
5. Shares the project with the bot at read+write.
6. Mints a long-lived API token for the bot via `PUT /tokens` with
   `owner_id`, scoped to the discovered route groups (tasks, comments,
   labels, relations, assignees, etc.) the server actually exposes.
7. Stores the token in your OS keychain (or
   `~/.config/veans/credentials.yml` if no keychain is available).
8. Writes `.veans.yml` to the repo root.

The token stored is the bot's, not yours. The human's transient session is
discarded as soon as init finishes — rotate or revoke the bot independently
without affecting your own session.

veans version
```

Task IDs accept `PROJ-NN` (when the project has an identifier), `#NN`
(when it doesn't), or a bare integer.

## `.veans.yml`

Committed to the repo root. The numeric IDs are the source of truth; cached
identifiers and bot username are for human-readable output.

```yaml
server: https://vikunja.example.com
project_id: 42
project_identifier: PROJ        # may be "" — task IDs render as #NN then
view_id: 7
buckets:
  todo: 11
  in_progress: 12
  in_review: 13
  done: 14
  scrapped: 15
bot:
  username: bot-myrepo
  user_id: 99
```

### Per-person bots: `.veans.local.yml`

`.veans.yml` is committed, so everyone in a repo shares the bot it names —
every claim and assignee reads `bot-<repo>`, and the board cannot tell who
did what. To give each person their own identity, drop a `.veans.local.yml`
beside it and **add it to `.gitignore`**:

```yaml
bot:
  username: bot-alice
  user_id: 42
```

Only the `bot` block is overridable. Project, view and bucket IDs stay
authoritative in the committed file, so everyone still reads the same board;
a stray local file cannot quietly point someone at another project. Both
fields are required — the token is looked up by username and "is this task
mine?" is answered by user_id, so half an override would authenticate as one
bot and filter for another, which surfaces as an empty ready queue rather
than an error.

Setup per person: an admin creates the bot user and shares the project with
it at read+write, then that person writes the file above and runs `veans
login`, which mints a token for whichever bot the config now resolves to.
`veans agents` then renders `bot-alice · for Alice`.

## Credentials

Resolved in order on every command:

1. **OS keychain** (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager,
   libsecret/gnome-keyring on Linux), via `github.com/zalando/go-keyring`.
2. **`VEANS_TOKEN`** env var (read-only). Optionally pin to a server with
   `VEANS_SERVER`. Intended for CI / containers.
3. **`~/.config/veans/credentials.yml`** (mode 0600) — automatic fallback
   when the keychain is unavailable. Honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

## Mage targets

```
mage build              # go build -o ./veans ./cmd/veans
mage test               # unit tests across the module
mage test:filter EXPR   # go test -run EXPR ./...
mage test:e2e           # e2e suite (needs VEANS_E2E_API_URL)
mage lint / lint:fix    # golangci-lint
mage fmt                # go fmt ./...
mage clean              # remove built binary
```

## End-to-end tests

The suite in `e2e/` assumes a running Vikunja API. Locally, point it at any
dev instance:

```sh
export VEANS_E2E_API_URL=http://localhost:3456
export VEANS_E2E_ADMIN_USER=user1
export VEANS_E2E_ADMIN_PASS=12345678   # canonical fixture password
mage test:e2e
```

CI spins Vikunja up the same way the frontend Playwright suite does — see
`.github/workflows/veans-e2e.yml`. The workflow builds the parent API
binary, starts it with `VIKUNJA_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`,
`VIKUNJA_DATABASE_PATH=memory`, fixtures from `pkg/db/fixtures/`, and runs
`mage test:e2e` from this directory.

E2E tests never touch the developer's keychain — they override `HOME` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` per test, which forces the credential store to fall
through to its file backend.

## Status model

| Status        | Bucket name    | Done flag | Who moves there?                         |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `todo`        | Todo           | false     | created here by default                  |
| `in-progress` | In Progress    | false     | `veans claim` / `update -s in-progress`  |
| `in-review`   | In Review      | false     | the agent, when work is finished         |
| `completed`   | Done           | true      | the merge hook when the PR lands, or a human |
| `scrapped`    | Scrapped       | true      | the agent, with `--reason`               |

The agent never moves tasks to `completed` itself — it parks them in
`In Review`, and merging the PR closes them (see *Merge hook* below).

## Claiming is atomic

`veans claim` calls `POST /api/v2/tasks/{id}/claim`, which checks, moves
and assigns in one server-side transaction (the current bucket row is read
under `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on Postgres and MySQL). Two agents racing for
the same task get exactly one winner; the loser exits non-zero with
`CONFLICT` and must pick another task. The claim also refuses a task that
has left the Todo bucket since it was listed, so acting on a stale
`list --ready` is safe. `--force` lifts the Todo guard (for picking up a
task a human parked In Review); nothing overrides another user's claim.
Re-claiming a task you already hold is a no-op.


## Scope and path leases

Every task can carry a scope — `paths_owned` (the files it will edit),
`paths_affected` (files it reads or depends on), `endpoints` and free-form
`notes` — written by whoever decomposes the work:

```
veans create "atomic claim" --paths-owned pkg/models/task_claim.go --paths-owned pkg/routes/api/v2/task_claim.go \
  --paths-affected pkg/models/tasks.go --endpoint "POST /api/v2/tasks/{id}/claim"
veans scope PROJ-12 --paths-owned frontend/src/components/tasks/**
```

Only `paths_owned` is enforced. `veans claim` leases those globs for the
project (`POST /tasks/{id}/claim` does it in the same transaction as the
assignment); a claim whose owned paths overlap a lease held by another
in-progress task is refused with `CONFLICT`, as is widening a claimed task's
scope onto a leased path. Leases go away when the task is done, scrapped,
deleted, or explicitly released (`veans release`). Overlap is judged on
patterns, conservatively: `pkg/models/**` collides with `pkg/models/tasks.go`
and with `pkg/**/*.go`.

Paths are repository-relative. A project that spans several repositories
namespaces them with a `repo:` prefix (`api:pkg/models/**`, `web:src/**`);
patterns in different repositories never collide. Set `repository: api` in
a checkout's `.veans.yml` and `veans create`/`veans scope` prefix bare paths
for you.

Bots set up before scopes existed hold tokens without the new
permissions; `veans login` mints a fresh token with everything the server
offers.

## Staying inside the lines

`veans check` lists the files changed since the main branch (or staged with
`--staged`), reads the `Refs:` trailers from the commits and asks
`POST /projects/{id}/scope-check` for a verdict per file: `owned`,
`affected` (declared read-only, yet changed), `unscoped`, or
`leased_by_other`. It exits `CONFLICT` on strays (when the referenced tasks
declare `paths_owned`) and on collisions. The `check` mode of the
`workman-merge-hook` action runs the same query on every pull request and
posts the verdict as a PR comment (see `examples/pr-hooks.yml`); the
`opened` mode links the PR on its tasks and parks them In Review, and
`ci-failed` (`examples/ci-failed-hook.yml`) comments failed runs.

## Planning a decomposition

`veans plan plan.json` sends a whole breakdown — tasks with plan-local keys,
`parent_key`, `blocked_by`, `follows` and scopes — to
`POST /projects/{id}/plan`, which lints it as a set and creates everything
in one transaction. Errors (duplicate or unknown keys, cycles, invalid
paths) stop creation; warnings (missing `paths_owned`, overlapping paths
without an ordering, overlap with an open task on the board) are reported
alongside the created tasks. `--dry-run` only lints. See `veans prime` for
the plan shape.

Re-planning is incremental: `veans plan --export` prints the open board in
the same shape keyed by identifier (`PROJ-12`, `#12`), and a plan may
reference those keys in `parent_key`, `blocked_by` and `follows` without
redefining them — the server resolves them against the board.

The ready queue is ordered: `veans list --ready` returns tasks in the
board's drag order and `--first` picks the top one, so the owner
prioritises by dragging cards in the Todo column.

## Stale leases

Leases record the holder's last activity — a claim, task update, comment or
`veans heartbeat`. After `service.leasestaleafter` (default 4h) without any,
`veans leases`, `veans ready` and the board flag them `stale`. They still
block; the flag tells a human they can release safely.

A cron on the server polices them every five minutes. The first time a lease
crosses the threshold, the holder is notified once — for a bot, the human
who owns it, since bots receive nothing. With `service.leaseautoreleaseafter`
set (default `0`, off; e.g. `24h`), leases silent for that long are released
outright: the task keeps its status and assignee, a comment on it says the
paths were freed, and the `task.leases.released` webhook fires so an
orchestrator can hand the work on.

## Who is working here

`veans agents` (`GET /api/v2/projects/{id}/agents`) lists every user assigned
to an open task or holding a lease, bots first with the `owner` behind each,
plus their open-task and lease counts. The board's "By assignee" lanes and
the Leases panel read the same answer to show `bot-alice · for Alice`.

## Orchestrating

`veans watch` polls the ready queue and the leases and prints one JSON line
per change: `task.ready` when a task becomes claimable (also for everything
already ready when the watcher starts), `task.unready` when a ready task is
claimed, blocked or removed, and `lease.stale` when a holder goes quiet.
`--exec CMD` runs a shell command per event with the JSON on stdin and in
`$VEANS_EVENT`; `--once` prints the current ready tasks and exits, for cron.
Transient server errors are emitted as `error` events and polling continues.

## Pre-commit hook

`veans hooks install` writes `.git/hooks/pre-commit` so every commit runs
`veans check --staged`; a stray or a collision aborts the commit with the
verdicts on stdout. Until a commit on the branch carries a `Refs:` trailer,
the check judges the index against the tasks the bot has claimed. `veans init --install-git-hook` does it during setup.
The hook is a no-op when veans is not on PATH or nothing is staged, and
`VEANS_SKIP_CHECK=1 git commit` bypasses it once. A pre-commit hook veans
did not write is never touched (`--force` replaces it); `veans hooks
uninstall` removes only the veans one.

`veans ready` is the server's ready queue (`GET
/projects/{id}/views/{view}/readiness`): every Todo task with `ready` and
the reasons it is not — `assigned`, `blocked` (with `blocked_by`) or
`lease_conflict` (with `lease_conflicts` naming the holder). `veans list
--ready` is that queue reduced to the claimable tasks, so agents and the
board never disagree about what can be picked up.
## Merge hook

`.github/actions/workman-merge-hook` in the parent repo closes the tasks a
merged PR references. It scans every commit on the PR for a `Refs:`
trailer (`Refs: PROJ-12`, `Refs: #12, #13`), marks each task done through
`/api/v2` and leaves a comment linking back to the PR. Already-done tasks
are skipped, so re-runs are safe. It is plain curl + jq — no veans binary
on the runner, and it works against a self-hosted Workman that GitHub
cannot reach inbound.

Copy `examples/merge-hook.yml` to `.github/workflows/` in a repo with a
committed `.veans.yml` and add the bot token as the `WORKMAN_TOKEN` secret.
The PR merge is the human gate: nobody has to touch the board.

## Marshal

`marshal` (built from `cmd/marshal`, same module) is the repo-aware layer over
the board: spec references that resolve from the repository at read time,
CODEOWNERS chokepoint queues, branch-vs-claim reconciliation, the ownership
lock on the board's In Progress column, CI gate receipts that gate "done",
per-worker worktrees with a database and port from a pool, a hash-chained
ledger, Discord cards for every pipeline event, and an MCP server for agents.
See `docs/marshal.md` for the design and `deploy/README.md` for running it
next to Workman behind a Cloudflare tunnel.

```
marshal init                   write .marshal.yml (spec files, CODEOWNERS, pool, service, Discord)
marshal setup --token <admin>  create the Marshal + CI bots, set receipt bot and claim bucket, register the webhook
marshal refs resolve|check     references with provenance; broken refs, pastes, unlinked tasks
marshal health                 the graph invariants
marshal chokepoints            CODEOWNERS queues
marshal open <path>            is anything open on this path
marshal reconcile              branches vs claims, stale branches
marshal worktree <task>        worktree command + database + port
marshal claims import          owns: labels → paths_owned
marshal receipt <task> ...     post a gate receipt as CI
marshal serve                  webhook receiver, panels API, watcher
marshal mcp                    agent tools over stdio
```

## Out of scope (for now)

- OAuth 2.0 device flow (RFC 8628) — would let SSH'd / headless setups
  authenticate without a browser-on-the-same-machine; not implemented
  upstream yet.
- Project-scoped API tokens — Vikunja doesn't ship them yet. The
  credential schema's `scope` field is forward-compatible for when it does.
- Auto-installing hook snippets. We print them; you paste them.
